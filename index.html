# CCM Benchmate
CCM Benchmate is an open-source toolkit for integrating and analyzing biological data from diverse public resources, literature, and your own research. Designed for bioinformaticians and computational biologists, it offers modular, interoperable components to build data pipelines and accelerate discovery.

To get started, please see the installation instructions. 
Each module is independently usable and well-documented—check out the README in each module's folder for details and code examples.

## Key Features
- Unified APIs: Access major bioinformatics databases (UniProt, NCBI, Ensembl, STRINGdb, and more) through a simple Python interface.
- Literature Search & Processing: Find, download, and extract content from scientific articles (PubMed, arXiv, OpenAlex), with tools for processing PDFs and full-text mining.
- Container Integration: Seamlessly run and manage Singularity/Apptainer containers locally or on HPC, with tools to convert and deploy your own environments.
- Genome, Sequence, and Variant Handling: Intuitive classes for genomic intervals, sequences, variants, and annotations.
- Structure Support: Import, analyze, or predict molecular structures using state-of-the-art models.
- Custom Knowledge Base: Store and query your processed data and analysis results using PostgreSQL + pgvector for advanced semantic search (coming soon).
